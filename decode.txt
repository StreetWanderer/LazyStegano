Lazy Stegano
==============
Inspired by a discussion with [MichaelPaulukonis](https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis) about using my [NanoGenmo algorithm](https://github.com/StreetWanderer/NaNoGenMo_2014) to create a steganography-like system that encode a text into an image.

About the code
---
The script maps each character from a text file to a shade of gray and save the result in a png file.

You can see the result with test.png and decode.txt who are based on this readme file.
