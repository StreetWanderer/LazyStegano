Lazy Stegano
==============
Inspired by a discussion with [MichaelPaulukonis](https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis) about using my [NanoGenmo algorithm](https://github.com/StreetWanderer/NaNoGenMo_2014) to create a steganography-like system that encode a text into an image.

About the code
---
The script maps each character from a text file to a shade of gray and save the result in a png file.

You can see the result with [message.png](https://github.com/StreetWanderer/LazyStegano/blob/master/message.png) and [decode.txt](https://github.com/StreetWanderer/LazyStegano/blob/master/decode.txt) who are based on this readme file.  


Improvements
----
* Find a way to support accents


Dependencies

* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.org/)
